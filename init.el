;; preable, use the built in package manager to bootstrap our package
;; management which is based on use-package
(require 'package)

;; add melps and org to the package archives we use
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/"))

;; and finaglly initialize package manager
(package-initialize)


;; the rest of this uses use-package to manage loading and configuring
;; packagess. if use-package isn't installed go fetch and install
;; it. this is super easy because our just configured package manager
;; can fetch use package for us.
