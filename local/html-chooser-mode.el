;;; Commentary:
;;
;; nxml-mode is an excellent mode for authoring XHTML (see
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/NxmlModeForXHTML), but it
;; only works for XHTML. Even people who prefer XHTML still must often
;; deal with legacy HTML documents, and so many people need to work
;; with files in both flavors.  Unfortunately, both usually have the
;; same .html or .htm extension, and so are treated identically by
;; auto-mode-alist.  If, as a result, you accidentally open an HTML
;; file in nxml-mode, Emacs churns CPU while it tried in vain to
;; validate it, until you kill the buffer.
;;
;; This file provides a dummy major mode called html-chooser-mode that
;; looks at a file, and if it seems to be XHTML, switches to
;; nxml-mode, and if it seems to be regular HTML, switches to
;; html-mode (or html-helper-mode, or whatever).  If the file is empty
;; or otherwise cannot be understood, the user is prompted to choose
;; which mode, and if empty, is offered the possibility of inserting
;; several skeletons or templates appropriate to that mode.
;;
;; In fact, you may not need html-chooser-mode at all, since you can
;; get most of its functionality by putting this in your .emacs file:
;;
;;  (setq magic-mode-alist (cons '("<\\?xml\\s " . nxml-mode) magic-mode-alist))
;;  (setq auto-mode-alist  (cons '("\\.x?html?$" . html-mode) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; In this way, all files with a .html extension will be opened in
;; html-mode, except for those containing <?xml at the start, which
;; will be opened in nxml-mode.  This doesn't handle new files well,
;; though: it puts them into html-mode, even if your intention is to
;; create an XHTML file with nxml-mode.  It also completely fails to
;; work on older versions of Emacs that don't implement
;; magic-mode-alist.  Hence html-chooser-mode.
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put these lines in your .emacs file:
;;
;;  (when (boundp 'magic-mode-alist)
;;    (setq magic-mode-alist
;;                (cons '("<\\?xml\\s " . nxml-mode) magic-mode-alist)))
;;
;;  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.x?html?$" . html-chooser-mode) auto-mode-alist))
;;  (autoload 'html-chooser-mode "html-chooser-mode")

;; Changes:
;;
;; 1.0 Initial release
;; 1.1 Don't offer to insert a template if there's already text in the
;;     buffer (as for HTML fragments)
