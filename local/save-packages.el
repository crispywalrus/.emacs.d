;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a little helper to synchronize installed ELPA packages
;; across hosts.  Call `save-packages' on one host, copy the output
;; file to another host, and call `install-saved-packages' there.
;;
;; You could call `save-packages' from an idle timer or
;; `kill-emacs-hook'.  And if you are slightly daring, you could try
;; calling `install-saved-packages' from your initialization file.
;;
;; If you need something more powerful than this, you might want to
;; look into el-get.
