;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:

;; come as close as possible to disabling gc during startup
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; Re-enable gc with a sensible limit (8Mb) after init process has ended
(add-hook 'after-init-hook
          #'(lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 8 1024 1024))))
