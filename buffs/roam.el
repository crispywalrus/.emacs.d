;;; Commentary:

;; This is an attempt at a usable org mode configuration.  Currently
;; this means some keyword config and few key bindings.  Then
;; additions to org-babel to use scala and sql.  Org-roam v2 has
;; replaced org-journal and a lot of my manual org file
;; editing.  Finally org-projectile rounds out the practical code.

;;; Code:

(require 'org-buffs)

(use-package org-roam
  :ensure t
  :init
  (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
  :config
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)
  (setq
   org-roam-directory (org-buffs:dangle-org-directory "roam")
   org-roam-dailies-directory (crispy:dangle-org-directory "daily")
   org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
     '(("d" "default" entry
        "* %?"
        :if-new (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org"
                           "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"))))
  (org-roam-setup))

(use-package org-roam-ui)
(use-package org-roam-timestamps)

;; (use-package vulpea)
(use-package zettledesk)
(use-package zettledesk-info)

(provide 'roam)
;;; roam.el ends here
