* Work Configuration

** Getting Started

Clone this repo into your ~/.emacs.d

** Goals

Stability and unsurprising usability. Initially I wanted to focus on
building a stable environment using melpa-stable packages to the
greatest extent possible but that just hasn't worked out. Usability
ended up triumphing and trampling stability

** Focus

Software engineering using scala and the rest of the jvm based
ecosystem.

*** Ensime for scala

Ensime adds a level of scala integration that none of the "real" IDE's
seem to be able to match. To me this is unsurprising as the authors
are scala devs first and IDE devs second.

*** Magit for git

Now able to handle almost all of my daily needs for interacting with
git. Only rarely do I need to interact with gits CLI porcelain anymore
(although I do because ... once you're in a shell buffer it's just so
easy to do the thing)
