* My Emacs Configuration

** Getting Started

Clone this repo into your ~/.emacs.d

** Goals

Stability and unsurprising usability. Initially I wanted to focus on
building a stable environment using melpa-stable packages to the
greatest extent possible but that just hasn't worked out. Usability
ended up triumphing and trampling stability

** Focus

Software engineering using scala and the rest of the jvm based
ecosystem.

*** Lsp and Metals for scala

Ensime was the bomb, back in the day. Now we have lsp. It's ok but it
can be better.

*** Magit for git

Perhaps the best git wrapper available anywhere.

*** Org mode

The most powerful outliner that a world of elisp programmers can build
